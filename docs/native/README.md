# MOLFAR Native preview

MOLFAR Native is the experimental Rust + GPUI app. The production app still
uses React/Tauri. Native builds have their own Cargo workspace and lockfile.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22+ and a current stable Rust toolchain.
- On macOS, Xcode with macOS components.
- Linux core checks need D-Bus headers and pkg-config (`libdbus-1-dev` and
  `pkg-config` on Debian/Ubuntu).
- At least one installed, signed-in agent CLI. See [provider coverage and limitations](parity.md#providers).

The native commands do not require `npm install` or a frontend build.
macOS is the primary preview target. A Linux ARM64 source build has been
smoke-tested in a VM; Linux x64 packages and Windows GUI interaction still need
runtime testing. See [preview limitations](parity.md).

Fenced `mermaid` blocks render as native diagrams in Markdown previews and
conversations. See [Mermaid diagrams](mermaid.md) for examples and limitations.
For interactive visuals, use `/visualize` in an idle local desktop conversation
or ask a Familiar directly. See [session visuals](visuals.md) and the
[preview release notes](preview-release-notes.md).

## Familiars

A Familiar's **Overview** tab brings together its current activity, a contribution
calendar, today's work, upcoming habits and new documents. **Sub-agents** lists
the sessions it launched, with their model, provider, checkout and state. Familiars
are prompted to delegate longer tasks to background sessions, whose final
reports return to the Familiar chat.

Contribution counts come from the Familiar's sessions, including saved history:
commits and pull requests opened, merged or reviewed through supported agent
tools. Opened pull requests are checked for later merges through the GitHub CLI.
Records are stored in `molfar.db.gpui.sqlite3` alongside native preferences
when using the installed desktop database.

In the Familiar's **Settings → General → Heartbeat** section, **Check in on its own**
controls inactivity checks. They are enabled by default with a 30-minute quiet
interval; choose 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour or 2 hours, or turn them off.
While the native app is running, an idle Familiar with an existing conversation can
review sessions, notes and inbox changes in its assigned projects and suggest
up to two follow-ups. It can also perform recurring checks already described
in its soul's standing instructions. New work is proposed for the user to accept.

Heartbeats keep the Familiar's selected permission mode and use its provider account,
with a smaller model when its catalog offers one. Quiet checks leave no report
or retained side session, and repeated quiet results extend the interval up to
four hours. Recent suggestions and the last check time are saved in the Familiar's
`heartbeat.json` file to avoid repeating
the same follow-ups after a restart. Scheduled habits take priority over
heartbeats. Live scheduler and provider behavior still need broader testing;
see [verification](verification.md).

## Develop

From the repository root:

```sh
npm run native:dev
```

Development uses a separate database. To open a particular project:

```sh
npm run native:dev -- --cwd /path/to/project
```

Type `r` then Enter in the terminal to rebuild and restart. The current app stays
open until the new build succeeds. Ctrl+C stops the app and runner. There is no
hot reload or automatic rebuild on save.

On macOS, the command packages and launches `MOLFAR Native.app`. Other
platforms launch the executable directly.

## Build

```sh
npm run native:build
```

This creates an optimized build without launching it. **The release app uses the
installed MOLFAR database, and changes save there.** No extra flags are needed.

On macOS, open:

```sh
open "crates/molfar-gpui/target/release/MOLFAR Native.app"
```

The app has a separate name and application ID (`com.molfar.native`) so it can be
installed alongside MOLFAR. Local source builds and published previews are not
notarized and have no configured automatic updates. After installing a preview on
macOS, open it once and choose **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**. Linux and Windows builds
produce a standalone executable
under `crates/molfar-gpui/target/release/`. `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` and
`CARGO_BUILD_TARGET` can change these output paths.

The **MOLFAR Native Preview** GitHub Actions workflow runs checks and build
verification.

## Data and configuration

Development stores `molfar.db` under:

| Platform | Development directory |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/com.molfar.native/` |
| Linux | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/com.molfar.native/`, or `~/.local/share/com.molfar.native/` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.molfar.native\` |

`MOLFAR_NATIVE_DATA_DIR` overrides this development directory.

Release builds open `com.molfar.desktop/molfar.db` under macOS Application
Support, Linux's XDG data directory, or Windows' `%APPDATA%`. The app uses the
existing desktop schema and session IDs. GPUI preferences are saved beside the
database in `molfar.db.native.sqlite3`. On first use, native imports an existing
`molfar.db.gpui.json` snapshot without changing the desktop database. Development
bundles use `com.molfar.native.dev` and display `MOLFAR Native (Development)`.

Supported desktop preferences and workspace state are read from the installed
app's webview localStorage on macOS and Linux. The Windows WebView2 reader is
implemented and covered by synthetic fixtures on Linux; reading a real Windows
profile remains unverified. Native preference edits are stored separately.
Some desktop layout concepts still need native support; see
[preview limitations](parity.md).

The Windows reader always opens a temporary copy of localStorage. Copying while
Tauri is writing is best-effort: an inconsistent copy can leave desktop
preferences incomplete or unavailable for that launch. Close Tauri before
starting GPUI for the first time. See [verification](verification.md) for
recorded checks.

To inspect the installed database without opening a window or changing it, use
the executable from a release build:

```sh
crates/molfar-gpui/target/release/molfar-native --check-data
```

On Windows, the terminal prefers PowerShell 7 (`pwsh.exe`), then Windows
PowerShell (`powershell.exe`), with `COMSPEC`/`cmd.exe` as the fallback. A `SHELL`
environment variable pointing to an installed native executable overrides this
order. Missing executables and Unix-only shell paths are ignored.

Provider CLI paths can be changed in Settings → Providers. CLI authentication
continues to use each provider's existing sign-in.

## Checks and fixtures

```sh
npm run native:check
```

This runs the script tests, Rust formatting, strict Clippy and native tests.
See [verification](verification.md) for individual commands, optional provider
checks and the latest recorded results.

A synthetic long-history fixture uses development data and makes no provider
request:

```sh
MOLFAR_NATIVE_DATA_DIR=/tmp/molfar-native-lab npm run native:dev -- --fixture
```

Fixtures are refused with production data. Use a fresh temporary directory when
you want an empty fixture store.

## Migration status

See [current status and next work](status.md), the [M01–M22 register](feature-transfer.md),
[preview limitations](parity.md) and [revision-scoped checks](verification.md).
Tauri remains the production release. The Native Packages workflow prepares a separate GitHub preview release path;
manual publication, signing configuration and platform acceptance remain gates.
See [release instructions](../releasing.md#two-release-paths). A local build does
not establish release or runtime acceptance.

## Contributing

See [architecture](migration.md) for the crate boundaries and renderer patches,
and [preview limitations](parity.md) for remaining work. The
[session visuals guide](visuals.md) documents the agent-facing visual API and
examples.

## BitChain Companion gateway

Settings → Connections → Companion controls the HTTP/Tailscale gateway used by
BitChain. The default listener is port 3775. Existing bind mode, public URL, port
and paired devices are retained when toggling it. Pairing uses the selected
store directory's `companion.json`; a native development store has its own file.
The shared desktop-data mode uses Tauri's pairing file; an isolated development
store does not.

One process can own the configured listener at a time. Stop the other gateway
before enabling this one. The bridge exposes overview, text transcripts, text
send/stop, access modes, approvals/questions, notes and session launch choices.
Launch choices validate model, effort and workspace mode before creating a
session; worktree mode creates an isolated checkout. Familiars keep their own
live conversation owner while exposing the underlying session ID to the phone.
Knowledge vault index, read and revisioned write are supported. Photo/file attachments and phone Board actions remain unsupported.

Gateway, RPC and temporary-checkout regression tests do not establish live
BitChain/Tailscale/provider acceptance. Those checks remain unrun. Tailscale
discovery runs on a bounded background worker; status reads cached results.
Host resource polls retain a CPU sampler and report a warming-up response until
a CPU delta is available.
